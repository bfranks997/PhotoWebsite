            <p>Over the last two weeks I have  learned HTML/CSS and javascript which has allowed me to build the website you are currently looking at. At this point in time I can build websites, put them on the internet, add animations as well as interactive interfaces onto them. This is all refered to as front-end development which is great, however, there is a whole other half to web development refered to as the back-end. I plan on diving into that realm in the coming weeks.</p>

        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>On November 4, 1979,  fifty-two American diplomats were held hostage in Iran for 444 days. The event, known as the Iran Hostage Crisis, occurred during the Iranian revolution and was a direct consequence of previously built-up tensions between the United States and Iran. The Hostage Crisis has had a major impact on US-Iran relations by turning what could have been a powerful revolution for Iranian independence into international isolation and sanctions.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1900s Iran was crucial to the foreign policy of powerful countries such as the United States and Great Britain due to Iran’s large oil reserves (Criss, 2007). Depending on who was in power in Iran, their oil could either be utilized to help the country or exploited for the benefit of the people in power. Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Prime Minister of Iran from 1951 to 1953, wanted to nationalize the Iranian oil industry instead of allowing foreign powers to control the oil. This was not in the best interest of the United States and Great Britain, so a coup was staged by both countries to take control of the oil and to prevent the spread of communism in Iran (Lucey, 2019). The coup removed the democratically elected Mosaddegh and placed Reza Shah as the monarchical leader. Reza Shah, or simply “the Shah” led the country with the intent of modernizing Iran in a secular, more Westernized fashion (Arfa, 2020). This combined with his strong relationship with the United States caused many Iranians to resent him. The dissatisfaction eventually led to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which resulted in the Shah, who was dying of cancer, to become exiled, and replaced by a man named Ruhollah Khomeini as the new leader. In contrast to Reza Shah, Khomeini was a deeply religious Shia Muslim, anti-American, and wanted to return Iran to its Islamic roots (“Ruhollah”, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>The goals of the Iranian revolution was not just about ridding Iran of the Shah but also removing any other connections to America from the country. Because of this, the US Embassy in Tehran was attacked by Iranian twice. The first attack occurred on February 14, 1979, which was perpetrated by the Organization of Iranian People’s Fedai Guerrillas, who took a single American from the embassy hostage (Congressional, 1981). This attempt, known as the Valentine’s Day Open House, was not long-lived, with negotiations resulting in the hostage being released after only three hours. Although the Shah had been exiled from his country, he played a major role in what happened in the following months. After being exiled, Reza needed treatment for his cancer and insisted on being treated in the United States. The U.S. government was split on how to handle the Shah’s situation. The president of the U.S. at the time, Jimmy Carter, was not in favor of letting him in, due to speculations that the U.S. embassy would be attacked a second time if the Shah entered the country (Sahimi, 2009). Despite this, Carter was eventually convinced to let him enter. After hearing about the Shah’s entrance, on November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian college students raided the U.S. embassy and took fifty-two American hostages. This second attack on the embassy was the beginning of the 444-day Iranian Hostage Crisis. 
        </p>
        <p>The second attack on the embassy was carried out by a group known as the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam’s Line who were lead by a student named Ebraham (Sahimi, 2009). After the embassy was taken over, the group demanded that the Shah was returned to Iran to stand trial and be executed. Originally, Ebraham and the students only planned to hold the hostages for a short time (Sahimi, 2009). This changed after the new face of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, completely endorsed the takeover. This is because when the students initially planned the event, they did not consult Khomeini and were planning to release the hostages if he disapproved (Sahimi, 2009). The embassy takeover was very popular in Iran as it was seen as a strike against American Imperialism.
        </p>
        <p>Since the embassy was a government building, there were many classified items being stored there. As soon as the guards of the embassy realized that people were breaking in, the ambassadors were notified and began destroying classified documents. Not everything could be destroyed in time and some destroyed documents were eventually put back together by the students. The students found documents showing that some of the staff members had been working with American intelligence agencies during the 1953 coup that put the Shah into power (Sahimi, 2009). Along with this, they found documents that proved the United States was trying to destabilize the new Iranian government that was being formed. These documents were used to justify the hostage crisis and the treatment of the hostages.
        </p>
        <p>While being held, the hostages were subject to poor conditions. Although no hostages were seriously injured, they reported being harrassed, blindfolded, and beaten. On top of this, the hostages were verbally harassed. Michael Metrinko, a hostage, was kept in handcuffs for two weeks for speaking his opinion of Khomeini. A very different story was told by Iranian propaganda which stated that the hostages were being very well taken care of. Initially, there were sixty-six hostages, however, thirteen women and African Americans were released between November 19th and 20th of 1979 (Sahimi, 2009). Along with this one man was released in July of 1980 after getting multiple sclerosis. The crisis created a sense of unity and patriotism in America as well as a social backlash against Iranians. 
        </p>
        <p>President Carter did not offer an immediate solution to the hostage crisis, however, on November 7, 1979, he did appoint delegates to negotiate the hostage crisis. Khomeini refused to negotiate. On November 12, 1979, Iran’s Foreign Minister reinstated that the hostages would be released if the US gave the Shah back to Iran (Sahimi, 2009). For the rest of 1979, not much progress was made in retrieving the hostages other than assets of the Iranian government in America being frozen. On April 7, 1980, President Carter ordered a rescue mission in order to free the hostages. The rescue attempt failed, damaging Carter’s chances of re-election while Khomeini’s influence in Iran skyrocketed when he attributed the failure to divine intervention (Sahimi, 2009). When the Shah died on July 27, 1980, the original terms that were necessary for the release of the hostages were not possible. Because of this Khomeini changed the terms on September 12th, 1980 claiming that the US needed to release all of the Shah’s assets being held in America in order for the hostages to be released. The Iranian government believed the assets were worth thirty-two billion dollars. Shortly after this on November 4, 1980, Ronald Reagan won the US presidential election. On January 19, 1981, an agreement was made between the United States and Iran in which the hostages would be released, and the US would free 8 billion dollars worth of Iranian assets that were being held in America. Just one day after this Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, and 20 minutes after his oath all of the hostages were released by Iran.
        </p>
        <p>Although the relationship between the United States and Iranians was never strong, the hostage crisis made things much worse. Neither country benefited from the event, however, the United States had the hostages returned while Iran did not receive what they originally desired. Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iran’s neighboring country, Iraq, saw the success of Khomeini and feared that the revolution could spread to them (Iran, 2020). Iraq wanted to pass Iran in terms of the strongest state in the Persian Gulf, and overtaking Iran was not possible under the Shah due to the strong economy and alliance with the United States. After the Iranian revolution, and more specifically the Hostage Crisis, Iran was weakened. Iraq then seized the opportunity to invade Iran not even a year after the hostage crisis starting the eight-year Iran-Iraq War (Iran, 2020). Because Iran had ruined its relationship with the United States, the US not only did not assist Iran in the conflict but also provided military aid to Iraq. The war devastated Iran economically and hurt its image on the world stage. The war ended in a stalemate on August 20, 1988, with hundreds of thousands dead and no changes in either countries borders. Anti-American sentiment grew in Iran and those accused of being associated with America were removed from power.
        </p>
        <p>Even though some might argue that relations between Iran and the United States have improved in recent years, the long term effects of the hostage crisis and the events prior to it can still be seen today. The event undoubtedly hindered the success of the Iranian revolution. Although there is no way to tell how things would have played out if the hostage crisis never happened, it is possible that the outcome of the Iran-Iraq war could have been different, or possibly never happened at all. The crisis gave Iranians a boost of confidence. They had held their own against the United States and displayed their ability to change the outcome of a U.S. election. Without this boost of confidence, Khomeini may have acted differently prior to the Iran-Iraq War which could have changed how the war played out. Along with this, Saddam Hussein invaded Iran because he saw how Iran was not only weakened by the revolution, but also by international isolation and sanctions. The revolution clearly weakened Iran temporarily. However, being on good terms with the United States would have greatly increased its international standing. Either way, avoiding the Iranian hostage crisis could have potentially saved hundreds of thousands of lives and sent Iran on a much faster route to prosperity.</p>
