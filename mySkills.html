                <h3>Electrical & Computer Engineering</h3>
            <p>I have spent many hours devoting myself to the study of electrical systems and have sharpened many useful skills in this area including</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Computer Architecture Design</h4>
                    <p>During my senior year at UofM a team of five students and I designed a synthesizable Out-of-Order RISC-V processor in System Verilog. This processor was based on the MIPS R10K scheme. For more details see the projects section of my website.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Controls System Design</h4>
                    <p>During my undergrad on a team of three students we designed a PID controller for which controlled the height of a levetating magnetic ball via current in an inductor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Digital Signal Processing and Wireless Communications</h4>
                    <p>One of my favorite areas of Electrical Engineering is DSP and Wireless Communications. The mathematics are extremely interesting to me and I am always excited to learn more about the subject.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Digital Logic Design and FPGA programming</h4>
                    <p>Beyond my capstone project designing a processor in System Verilog, I also have done many projects using Verilog on FPGAs. Notable projects include a traffic light intersection simulator as well as an NES controller Interface.</p>

                <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                <p>Along with electrical engineering, I have also learned much about developing software applications using the following skills</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>C++</h4>
                        <p>I am most comfortable with C++ of all programming languages. Most of the projects on my github were build using C++. Notworthy subskills of C++ I have are: arduino programming, object and oriented programming.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>C#</h4>
                        <p>A strong secondary language I know and have developed several personal programs in. Noteworthy subskills of C# are GUI and OOP</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Python</h4>
                        <p>I have worked one job using python and am somewhat familiar with this language although it is not a language that I am most familair with.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
